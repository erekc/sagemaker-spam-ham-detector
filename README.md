# sagemaker-spam-ham-detector
This project was inspired by the AWS SageMaker spam-ham detection example. The concept was extended to build an app that uses SES, Lambda, SageMaker, and S3 to build an application that communicates to the sender whether their message was classified as SPAM or HAM with a given confidence level. The app is then deployed using CloudFormation.
